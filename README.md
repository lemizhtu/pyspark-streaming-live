# PySpark Streaming Live

Our task for today:

1. Implement a simple streaming use-case:
    - Given a stream of purchase transactions from a retail store
    - Filter the purchases by their total order volume
    - The filter uses an upper and lower bound
2. Test the implementation with a unit test
3. Do this in a test-driven manner: start with the test
